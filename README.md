# JS Zero to Hero

## Overview

What I've learnt from textbooks, courses, school and universities about JavaScript. Including all topics covered from Fundamentals to Advanced.

Learning JavaScript is a great choice, not only because it's the most popular programming language in the world, but also because it basically powers the entire modern web. Let's take a couple of minutes to get a quick overview very basics of the JavaScript language, to have a solid foundation.

- Some general skills like problem solving, fixing errors,
- DOM manipulation
- How JavaScript actually works.
- Modern ES6 topics: Maps and destructuring.
- Strings, functions, closures, and more.
- Array methods, numbers, dates, and timers.
- Visual effects and components, such as lazy image loading, a tapped component, a slider.
- Constructor functions and ES6 classes.
- Object oriented programming.
- How to actually plan and structure a project.
- Asynchronous JavaScript, which is used for things like loading data from external web servers with Ajax.
- How modern JavaScript applications are actually built using cutting edge technologies like NPM, Babel, Parcel and ES6 modules.
- Deployment with Netlify in Git.
